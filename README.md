How It Works
QuickFix has streamlined the process of obtaining vehicle repairs to ensure maximum convenience and efficiency for our customers. The procedure is designed to be straightforward and user-centric, involving a few simple steps to get your vehicle serviced and back on the road.
Firstly, customers can initiate a service request by choosing their preferred booking method. This can be done either through our online platform, which offers an intuitive interface for selecting services and scheduling appointments, or by directly calling our customer service line for a more personal interaction.
Secondly, upon booking, customers are presented with the option to choose between an onsite repair service or a vehicle pick-up service. For onsite repairs, our certified mechanics will travel to the customer's location to perform the necessary work. Alternatively, if the repair requires more extensive attention or if the customer prefers, our team will arrange to pick up the vehicle from their specified address and transport it to our repair facility.
Thirdly, once the service option is confirmed and the vehicle is accessible to our team, our certified mechanics will proceed with the repairs. We are committed to providing same-day repair services whenever feasible, understanding the importance of minimizing vehicle downtime for our customers. Our mechanics are equipped with the necessary tools and expertise to address a wide array of automotive issues efficiently.
Finally, after the repairs are completed and the vehicle has undergone a quality check, it is returned to the customer, or the customer is notified that the onsite repair is complete. The aim is to ensure that you are back on the road with minimal hassle and delay, allowing you to resume your daily activities without significant interruption. QuickFix also provides transparent pricing for its convenience fees associated with pick-up and delivery services in Hyderabad, with charges clearly itemized on the invoice as a "Convenience Charge." The fee structure is based on distance bands: up to 5 km is ₹60, 5-10 km is ₹100, and over 10 km is ₹150.
